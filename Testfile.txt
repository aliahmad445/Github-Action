jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    needs: [job1, job2]


jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    if: ${{ always() }}
    needs: [job1, job2]

In this example, job3 uses the always() conditional expression so that it always runs after job1 and job2 have completed, regardless of whether they were successful.
